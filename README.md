This repository will be used to host various Java projects which demonstrate the recipes contained in "Java Cookbook 2nd. Edition" by Ian F. Darwin.

I will separate each concept by a separate Java project, so branching the entire repository is unneccesary if you wish to view a single example.

The code for all examples was written in NetBeans on an Ubuntu 14.04 VM.
